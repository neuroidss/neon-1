# 9. Integrate Holochain

Date: 2018-09-14

## Status

Proposed

## Context

[Holochain](https://holochain.org/) is a "post-blockchain" architecture for distributed apps with no central bottlenecks and no reference to global state. 

Its [whitepaper](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-proto/blob/whitepaper/holochain.pdf) positions Holochain as an alternative to Ethereum, describing an "agent-centric distributed generalized computing system, where nodes can still confidently participate in the system as whole even though they are not constrained to maintaining the same chain state as all other nodes."

## Decision

Explore Holochain as a replacement for [Ethereum](0006-integrate-ethereum.md) in our model.

[Explore](https://github.com/Entryist/holochain-rnbridge-example) a mobile integration of Holochain into our React Native mobile apps.

## Consequences

Usual considerations of being on the 'bleeding edge' of integrating new technology.

Potential to remove [bottlenecks](0006-integrate-ethereum.md) associated with Ethereum scaling.
