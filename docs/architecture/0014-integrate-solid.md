# 14. Integrate Solid

Date: 2018-09-30

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Solid is a decentralized web platform [backed](https://www.fastcompany.com/90243936/exclusive-tim-berners-lee-tells-us-his-radical-new-plan-to-upend-the-world-wide-web) by Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the world wide web.

Solid can potentially replace our client-server model, with similar considerations to our potential [Blockstack](0012-integrate-blockstack.md) integration.

Blockstack appears to have more mature developer tooling. Solid is closer to the mainstream web standards community which may lead to a larger coalition and more resources over time.

## Decision

Explore production readiness of Solid for our use case. Start by setting up a Solid server and testing authentication.

## Consequences

Potential trade-offs with usability. Uncertain production readiness. May need to build tooling ourselves. Opportunity to contribute to a new ecosystem.
