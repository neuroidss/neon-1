# 5. Integrate Arcade Tokens (ARCD)

Date: 2018-09-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Arcade Tokens (ARCD) represent stake in the Arcade ecosystem as detailed in our [whitepaper](http://arcade.city/whitepaper) and [economics summary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m1Fgm-dMm8mVmYldAUA_2tCnVnCbh2mVaPvkb0rmSEU).

ARCD is an ERC20 token and will remain so for the foreseeable future.

Users need an easy way to acquire, hold, and stake ARCD.

## Decision

Integrate an Ethereum wallet into Neon for easy use of ARCD.

## Consequences

Use of the token is limited by the throughput, functionality and security of the Ethereum network.
