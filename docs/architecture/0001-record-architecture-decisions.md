# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2018-09-13

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We should record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as introduced by Michael Nygard in [this article](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) and explained further [here](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record).

## Consequences

Adds clarity for our team and enables easier onboarding of new developers.

More effort required to keep ADRs up to date.
