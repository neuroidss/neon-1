# 2. Integrate Bitcoin

Date: 2018-09-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Arcade City needs a global 'currency of the realm'.

Say a guild leader in Manila wants to pay a tip to two drivers, one in Austin and one in SÃ£o Paulo, as a thank  you for a comprehensive training program they wrote for new drivers.

Should they use PayPal? Or the world's first and most secure global, decentralized, digital currency -- and with zero fees thanks to the [Lightning Network](0003-integrate-lightning.md)?

## Decision

Use bitcoin as the global currency of Arcade City. Integrate a user-friendly bitcoin wallet into core products. "Don't compete with Bitcoin."

## Consequences

Our ecosystem will have digital 'sound money' with a ten year track record of security.

Will need to devote some resources to education about handling cryptocurrency.
